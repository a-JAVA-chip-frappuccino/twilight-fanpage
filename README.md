# Twilight Fanpage

## Description

This project is written in its entirety on the client-side, utilizing React.js, HTML, and CSS code and markup to emulate a Tumblr-style Twilight fanpage. As you traverse through the components, it shows you a series of "comments", images, and quotes all determined by the component or stored in a JSON file to emulate a backend.
